# Some miscellaneous Scripts

## A Place for my own (Tampermonkey)User-Scripts, I wrote for convenience or just for Fun

#### Scripts:
- YouTube Mouse Skip & Volume-Control: 
  - Lets you skip Forward/Backward by Double-Right-Clicking on a Video like you would in the Mobile-App.
  - utilizing YouTube's own UI-Element and improving on it (the Culmination of skipped Seconds gets displayed)
  
  - Control Volume with the mouse-wheel, displaying Youtubes own Ui
  - _**Known Issues:**_
 
- Twitch Mouse Skip
  - Lets you skip Forward/Backward by Double-Right-Clicking on a Video.
